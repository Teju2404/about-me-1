I am a junior at Northwest Missouri State University working on earning my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Digital Media. I hale from Lee's Summit Missouri, having previously attended Lee's Summit West Highschool. I have interned at Rivet and Glynndevins in Kansas City, doing web development work for them both. My hobbies are cooking and video games. 

For the future, I plan to secure a job where I can spend all-day developing and updating sites for a marketing agency's clients.
